# Introduction to JavaScript

JavaScript is a versatile, high-level programming language that has become one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS.

## What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a programming language that enables interactive web pages and is an essential part of web applications. The vast majority of websites use it for client-side page behavior.

> **Note:** JavaScript was created in 1995 by Brendan Eich while he was working at Netscape Communications.

## Key Features

### Dynamic Typing
JavaScript is dynamically typed, meaning you don't need to specify variable types explicitly.

### First-Class Functions
Functions in JavaScript are treated as first-class citizens, meaning they can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments, and returned from other functions.

## Basic Syntax

Here are some fundamental JavaScript concepts:

### Variables
```javascript
let name = "John";
const age = 30;
var city = "New York";
```

### Functions
```javascript
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}
```

> **Alert:** Always use `const` for values that won't change and `let` for variables that will be reassigned.

## Modern JavaScript (ES6+)

Modern JavaScript includes many powerful features like:
- Arrow functions
- Template literals
- Destructuring
- Modules
- Classes

## Conclusion

JavaScript is an essential language for web development. Understanding its fundamentals will help you build interactive and dynamic web applications.
