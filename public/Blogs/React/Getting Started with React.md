# Getting Started with React

React is a powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications where you need a fast, interactive user experience.

## What is React?

React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called "components."

> **Note:** React was created by Facebook and is now maintained by Facebook and the community.

## Key Concepts

### Components
Components are the building blocks of any React application. They let you split the UI into independent, reusable pieces.

### JSX
JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like code in your JavaScript files.

## Setting Up Your First React App

To get started with React, you can use Create React App, which sets up a modern web development environment with no configuration.

```bash
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm start
```

> **Alert:** Make sure you have Node.js installed on your system before running these commands.

## Your First Component

Here's how to create your first React component:

```jsx
function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>;
}
```

## Conclusion

React provides a solid foundation for building modern web applications. With its component-based architecture and virtual DOM, it offers excellent performance and developer experience.
