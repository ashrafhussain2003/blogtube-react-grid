# Introduction to Node.js

Node.js is a powerful JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It allows developers to run JavaScript on the server side, opening up new possibilities for web development.

## What is Node.js?

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a web browser. It was created by Ryan Dahl in 2009.

> **Note:** Node.js is not a programming language or a framework; it's a runtime environment for JavaScript.

## Key Features

### Non-blocking I/O
Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient.

### Single-threaded Event Loop
Node.js operates on a single-threaded event loop, making it highly scalable for I/O-intensive applications.

### NPM Ecosystem
Node.js comes with NPM (Node Package Manager), which provides access to the largest ecosystem of open-source libraries.

## Installing Node.js

You can download Node.js from the official website at nodejs.org. The installation includes both Node.js and NPM.

```bash
# Check Node.js version
node --version

# Check NPM version
npm --version
```

> **Alert:** Always download Node.js from the official website to ensure security and authenticity.

## Your First Node.js Application

Create a simple HTTP server:

```javascript
const http = require('http');

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' });
  res.end('Hello, Node.js!');
});

server.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server running at http://localhost:3000/');
});
```

## Use Cases

Node.js is excellent for:
- Web servers and APIs
- Real-time applications
- Microservices
- Command-line tools
- IoT applications

## Conclusion

Node.js has revolutionized JavaScript development by bringing it to the server side. Its performance, scalability, and vast ecosystem make it a popular choice for modern web applications.
