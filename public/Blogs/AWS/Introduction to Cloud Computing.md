# Introduction to Cloud Computing

Cloud computing has revolutionized how businesses and individuals access and use computing resources. Instead of owning and maintaining physical servers, users can access computing power, storage, and applications over the internet.

## What is Cloud Computing?

Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services—including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence—over the Internet ("the cloud") to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale.

> **Note:** The term "cloud computing" was popularized in the early 2000s, but the concept has been around since the 1960s.

## Types of Cloud Services

### Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
Provides virtualized computing resources over the internet.

### Platform as a Service (PaaS)
Offers hardware and software tools over the internet, typically for application development.

### Software as a Service (SaaS)
Delivers software applications over the internet, on a subscription basis.

## Benefits of Cloud Computing

### Cost Efficiency
Pay only for what you use, reducing capital expenditure on hardware.

### Scalability
Easily scale resources up or down based on demand.

### Accessibility
Access your applications and data from anywhere with an internet connection.

> **Alert:** Always consider security and compliance requirements when moving to the cloud.

## AWS and Cloud Computing

Amazon Web Services (AWS) is one of the leading cloud service providers, offering over 200 fully featured services from data centers globally.

## Key AWS Services

- **EC2**: Virtual servers in the cloud
- **S3**: Scalable storage in the cloud
- **RDS**: Managed relational database service
- **Lambda**: Run code without provisioning servers

## Conclusion

Cloud computing has transformed the IT landscape, offering unprecedented flexibility, scalability, and cost-effectiveness. AWS provides a comprehensive platform to leverage these benefits for businesses of all sizes.
